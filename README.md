Python Weather App üå¶Ô∏è
This project is a simple Python-based weather forecast application that simulates fetching weather information for cities. It uses hardcoded weather data to provide an interactive experience.

Features
Allows users to input a city name to view its weather forecast.
Provides detailed weather information, including:
Current temperature
Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy)
Wind speed
Humidity
Ensures input validation by accepting only city names from the predefined list.
Design Goals
The program is structured to ensure clarity, modularity, and ease of use. Invalid inputs are handled gracefully, with opportunities for users to try again.
